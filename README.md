# New-Image-Beauty-Salon-Website
I love designing, especially graphical user interfaces, which is why I really wanted to learn HTML and CSS. This was my very first attempt using both and I plan to improve in what I have learned.

This project was made for my own learning purposes, however I decided that the theme for this project would be my mother's hair salon. 
This was definitely a fun learning experience and I hope you all like it!
