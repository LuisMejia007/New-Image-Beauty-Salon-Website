# New-Image-Beauty-Salon-Website
I always wanted to learn how to code in HTML and CSS because I love designing things. 
I decided to learn the basics of HTML and CSS by taking on this project. 
This project was made for my own learning purposes, however I decided that the theme to this project would be my mother's hair salon. 
This was definitely a fun learning experience and I hope you all like it!

Unfortunately since this is a local project the only way the images will display will be to download them all in the zip file. 
Many credit goes to the photographers of the images I used. In my best efforts I tried to give them credit but many of these images 
were scattered around in multiple websites that it was difficult to pin the original source. Keep in mind though that this was only
for my learning purposes, in no way am I trying to take credit for their pictures.
